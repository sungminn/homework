Question #1

1. Why can you only use certain pins for analogWrite()?
- You can only use certain pins for analogWrite() because you can only analogWrite() to one of the conflicting pins.
If analogWrite() is used with two different pins at the same the,the value of the PWM signal
would be equal to each other even though the values were written differently.

Question #2

2. What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range?
- The range of the map function maps the value to not constraint values within the range 
because sometimes out-of-range values are intended and useful.The map function also uses integers 
math which does not generate fractions when the math might indicate that it should do so.
