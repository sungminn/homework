1. Give an example, in your own words, when you might use an if statement in P5 (or Arduino)

- Use the IF function to specify a block of code to be executed only if a specified condition is true
- Then use ELSE to specify a block of code to be executed if the same condition is false


2. Describe, in your own words, the role of the condition of a while or for loop.

- The WHILE function loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
- FOR Loops allow you to run through the loop when you know how many times you'd like it to run through the problem such as for (var i; i < 10; i++); this will continually increase i untill that condition returns false, any number can replace the 10 even a variable. but it will quit once the condition is no longer being met. This is best used again for loops that you know how when they should stop.
- Key difference between WHILE and FOR loops are the organization systems.It’s easy to think that FOR statements are cleaner version of the WHILE loop.

3. In the following code, what is printed for the final value of the variable z, after all the code runs?

var z = 0;
while (z < 19) {
z = z + 6;
}
println(z);

- First of all, println() is a method in PrintStream class to print all data values. As of how the function is while “z” is less than 19, z = z + 6. then “z” would have to be 18 in order to be less then 19 which if “z” is 18, it will be 18+6 =24; 24 < 19. Therefore, 18 would be the final value for “z” after all code runs.

6. a)until i is 5 it will run so 5 times. 
   b)99 times. b/c i is less then numPoints. numPoint = 100 so for the for function as TRUE, it will only go up to 99 and change into FALSE when the amount hits 100.

7. Match the following inputs and outputs to the best command to interact with each

- Control the brightness of an LED = analogWrite
- Turn on or off an LED = digitalWrite 
- Read a value from a light-dependent resistor = analogRead
- Determine if an input is HIGH or LOW = digitalRead 

8. void setup () {
	pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
digitalWrite(3,HIGH)
delay(100)
digitalWrite(3,LOW)
delay(100)
}

- if you want it to blink on 200, you have to split that (so 100) in order it to “BLINK” 5 times in 1 second.
- a single blink requires a set of delay in order to blink
